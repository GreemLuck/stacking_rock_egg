# Egg Radii Calculator

This is a simple website I created to help my brother calculate the radii of an egg shape at different heights. The tool has been very helpful for him in his rock stacking egg projectâ€”one of his many creative endeavors as a landscaper.

## How to Use

2. **Enter Egg Size:** Input the overall size of the egg.
3. **Specify Number of Floors:** Enter the number of levels you need.
4. **View Results:** The website will calculate and display the radii for each level.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Shapes:** Extend the calculator to include other shapes.
- **Improved Visualizations:** Enhance the graphical display of results.

## Acknowledgements

A special thank you to my brother for inspiring this project.
